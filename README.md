# Nebula Data Schemas
*Schemas for the Nebula Data Service*

## Development

**A work in progress**

## About
Many Project Nebula projects use the same interfaces for user data. Part of
[Project Nebula](https://github.com/acmutd/nebula-web), Nebula Data Schemas are
a collection of TypeScript interfaces and that define core Project Nebula data
models and documentation on how they should be used.

This repository, `nebula-data-schemas` contains data types used across several
Project Nebula codebases.
